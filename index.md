# About this Website

---

Relks.org serves as a personal catalog for my FPGA projects and learning resources. I've experimented with creating numerous websites in the past, many of which I never brought forward to the public eye. At this point, I've easily created a dozen or so websites. None of them really sat right with me; I was never a huge fan of writing out massive explanatory excerpts. I just wanted a simple website with code, schematics, and brief lightweight descriptions in the form of bullet points. This website is not tutorial-focused, but feel free to use things you find here in your own endeavors.

### Website Contents

1. SystemVerilog and Verilog. *maybe VHDL in the future*  
2. Microblaze, Zynq, and RISC-V
3. Constraint Files
4. Xilinx FPGAs *maybe I'll experiment with Lattice FPGAs in the future*
