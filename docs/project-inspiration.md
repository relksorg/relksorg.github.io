# Project Inspiration

{: .fs-8 }
Staying motivated to continue working on projects is hard. Especially after many years. Often times I find it refreshing to return to the roots and see what your end goal realy is. In my personal experience, it's helpful to refer to those who've come before this generation to acomplish the impossible and take what they say as fuel to add to the creative fire.
