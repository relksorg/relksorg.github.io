<h1>Technical Prep and Resume review</h1>

### 1) Homemade Networking Project Review
- Manchester encoding, colliding values will bring line low for too long - simply check for that. Idle is when everything goes high again (idle) re-attempt again - random retransmit with Linear Feedback shift registers (LFSR).
- LFSR - Q goes to D of flipflop then that q goes to next d etc…
- CRC8 construction generated from outputlogic site, still made testbenches for that, had to set initial value to another value though. (talk about that how this is the issue with codegen)
- Lil python script that would call on a .tcl file and run a vivado project creation with top_module set job #s top level, vhdl2008, “launch_simulation -simset sim_1”
- Use python with sys, and os to parse argos then run vivado in batch mode

### 2) Broadcast UDP
- Why UDP. SUPER BASIC LOL hard coded most with generics. Not that intelligent, good for just yelling into the void (no feedback).
- MII (media independent interface). Tx error, tx enable, tx clock, txd[3:0] same pins on rx side.
- Added a new clock in constraints, {0 20} that’s a 40ns period clock soooo 25mhz clk for mii.
- Problem encountered: wasn’t seeing any packets, ILAs seemed fine… Butttt it turns out that when your CRC is wrong the switch will drop it :)

### 3) Inference of Quantized Neural Networks
- Simple Neural networks with linear layers, (1,4) (4,16) (16,1)
- Quantize, so project into int16/8/4 territory. The maximum weight / bias maps to the maximum intn value. 
- Uses DSP slices, built in MAC (multiply accumulate unit) 
- DSP Blocks  
  - 27 x 18 signed multiply  
  - 48-bit adder/accumulator  
  - 27-bit pre-adder  
- Double check but I think it's called a DSP48E2

### Trivia like questions:
- 3 ways to cross a clock domain : Async FIFO, Handshaking, Double flip flop 
- Melee vs Moore: these are state machines. Melee depends on current state and the inputs, Moore just depends on current state. 
- Inference: you “infer” the synthesis tool to place some type of component down. 
- Instantiation: directly create the primitive component based on something like the user guide. 
- Instantiation is better for explicitness but to infer components is better for cross platform.
- Flip flop will pass data from D to Q on the clock edge. A latch DOES NOT use a latch. in general Latches should be avoided (uncovered edge cases)
- A latch output will only change whenever an input change occurs, there is also sometimes an enable pin to reflect the changes from their input side. 
- JTAG (Joint Test Action Group). 
- Stack = Static stuff like int x = …. And the heap is dynamic like malloc and free.
- Likely question, why include a reset because on a turn on it could be an unpredictable state a reset gives you clarity and certification that after asserting the reset higher low. Depending on what you decide, it'll be an unknown State.
- Max value with bits, 2^8 = 256 possible values, max value is 2^8 - 1
- CLBs (Configurable logic blocks) fundamental building block of FPGAs, consist of logic cells which can be programmed for sequential / combinational logic. Usually contain a LUT for programming the behavior of any logic function and then also has a FF for keeping a state.
- CDC (Clock Domain Crossing).
- Metastability = occurs when signal violates setup or hold time usually occurs when a signal is transferred between circuitry in unrelated or async clock domains.
- Metastability means a FF can settle to correct or incorrect value within an uncertain time.
- Setup time = data input muist arrive and stay steady for a duration of time before clock edge, changing too close to the edge the FF may grab the wrong value.
- Hold time = after clock edge the data must remain unchanged for brief period before moving on, FF could sample wrong value or go metasatable.
- Timing closure is making sure you meet setup and hold time.
- Slack in vivado: Positive slack means you’re meeting timing, zero slack means you’re barely meeting timing, negative slack means you have a timing violation.
- Slack = required time - arrival time, so slack is the margin between required arrival time and the actual arrival time of signal.
- LUT = Look up table, fundamental building block of an FPGA that implements combinational logic. It’s a small configurable memory unit that stores a truth table for a given logic function.
- Every python file is a module, when a file is imported as a module into another py script __name__ is set to the module’s filename instead. So set the __name__ == “__main__” to only run this code if this file is being executed directly, not when imported by another file.
- Python 3.10.4, 3.13.3
- with open("matmult_GEN.vhd", "w") as f:  
  Opens a file named matmult_GEN.vhd, w means write mode so if it exists then overwrite  
  Open returns file object that you can write to and read from etc…
- Multithreading - creating multiple threads in the smae process that will share the same memory space (RAM) and same variables & objs.
- In C fork() creates a new process. pthread_create() creates a new thread in C.
- Python features you like: string formatting is easy with print(f”hey {varname}”)
- I also really like the os and subprocess modules for quick system automation:  
  Import subprocess -> subprocess.run([“pip”, “flag”, “stuff”])  
  String interpolation is the print(f’hey {a}’)
- Directed testing vs constrained-random testing. Directed testing is like looking for known behaviors using known testing. Stimulus constrained random testing is using random values maybe across like a bus but still using known values on like resets or enable pins.
- SystemVerilog Basics since you know VHDL more:
  - Non blocking <=  
  - Blocking =  
  - always_comb automatically executes once at time zero. It is sensitive to changes within the contents of a function.  
  - Always_ff @(posedge clk) begin … end. Represents a latch hence the sensitivity to a clock  
  - always_latch begin  
      if (enable) begin  
         a_latch <= something;  
      end  
      //No else clause so a_latch's value  
      //is not always defined, so it holds its value  
    End  
  - Use assign for combinational logic. A type of wire or similar datatypes can be driven continuously with a value so constant or combinational.  
  - The SystemVerilog keywords are preferred, always_comb always_ff and always_latch.  
  - Statemachines in sv  
    typedef enum logic [1:0] {STT_DATA,  
                              STT_STOP,  
                              STT_WAIT  
                              } statetype;  
    statetype                 state;  
    case(state)  
     STT_DATA: begin ….. End  
     Default: begin … End  
    End case

- UVM Basics:
  - Agent contains the monitor, sequencer, driver  
  - Env contains the scoreboard and agent  
  - Test contains the env, interface, and DUT  
  - Interface connects to monitor, interface connects to driver  
  - Monitor connects to scoreboard  
  - Sequencer connects to driver.
